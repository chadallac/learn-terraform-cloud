# Terraform Cloud Getting Started Guide Example

This is an example Terraform configuration intended for use with the [Terraform Cloud Getting Started Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cloud-get-started/cloud-sign-up).

## What will this do?

This is a Terraform configuration that will create an EC2 instance in your AWS account. 

When you set up a Workspace on Terraform Cloud, you can link to this repository. Terraform Cloud can then run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` automatically when changes are pushed. For more information on how Terraform Cloud interacts with Version Control Systems, see [our VCS documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/run/ui.html).
